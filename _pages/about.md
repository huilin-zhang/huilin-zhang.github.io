Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral researcher in economics at Purdue University. My research focuses on Urban Economics, Spatial Economics, International Trade and Applied Microeconomics. My current projects use structural models and reduced-form methods to explore topics related to the labor market, including (1) productivity externalities and optimal policies, (2) globalization and CEO compensation, and (3) student-university matching and human capital production.

Working Papers

**Productivity Externalities of Working from Home: Welfare and Policy Implications** [[PDF]](files/TelecommutingPaper.pdf)<br>
I study how the socially optimal level of onsite work differs from the market equilibrium. I develop a general equilibrium model in which workers decide how much to work onsite and work from home. Productivity spillovers can occur within and between onsite and remote workers. The model predicts that the balance between onsite and remote productivity spillover effects affects the gap between the socially optimal and the market equilibrium level of onsite work. I measure these spillovers by matching the model to U.S. survey data from 2022 to 2024 at the city-sector-work mode level. I find that, on average, a social planner could improve welfare by 2% by increasing hybrid workers' share of onsite time by 3% and increasing the number of fully onsite workers by 2%. This could be accomplished by offering a subsidy for onsite work equal to 11% of hybrid workers' gross income. Without the remote productivity spillovers, a similar level of welfare improvement would require larger changes: hybrid workers' share of onsite time would need to increase by 5%, and the number of fully onsite workers would need to increase by 3%. The subsidy would cost 15% of hybrid workers' gross income.

**Using Global Shocks to Understand the Level and Structure of Executive Compensation（with David Hummels, and Jakob R. Munch）** <br>
We build a model of CEO compensation that unites principal-agent and assignment models in the face of trade shocks that interact with CEO effort to change the value of the firm. The model predicts that globalization changes CEO compensation through scale, volatility, and ability-magnification channels. Using Danish matched worker-firm data, we find empirical support for most of these channels: (1) Exogenous shocks to trade
increase the value of the firm and CEO compensation; (2) the share of firm value paid to the CEO is increasing in the size of the firm and the volatility induced by global shocks; (3) Higher-ability CEOs are paid more but their value to the firm comes from mitigating losses rather than maximizing the return to positive shocks.

**The Production of Human Capital in A System of Universities (with David Hummels)** <br>
We build a general equilibrium model to answer the following questions: (1) How do shocks—such as increasing manufacturing wages and technological changes—affect the number and quality of colleges and the distribution of human capital in society? (2) How do changes in borrowing costs affect intergenerational human capital formation? The model features matching between heterogeneous students and universities. Students receive higher human capital from a good match between their ability and university quality.
